-f' can.

=== Usage

File::Tail is a module in the File class. A lightweight class interface for
logfiles can be seen under File::Tail::Logfile.

Direct extension of File objects with File::Tail works like that:
 File.open(filename) do |log|
   log.extend(File::Tail)
   log.interval = 10
   log.backward(10)
   log.tail { |line| puts line }
 end

It's also possible to mix File::Tail in your own File classes
(see also File::Tail::Logfile):
 class MyFile < File
   include File::Tail
 end
 log = MyFile.new("myfile")
 log.interval = 10
 log.backward(10)
 log.tail { |line| print line }

The forward/backward method returns self, so it's possible to chain
methods together like that:
 log.backward(10).tail { |line| puts line }
